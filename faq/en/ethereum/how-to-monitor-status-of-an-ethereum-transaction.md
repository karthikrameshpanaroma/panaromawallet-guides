# How to monitor the status of an Ethereum transaction

You've provided a clear overview of how the Panaroma Decentralized wallet allows users to monitor the status of their Ethereum transactions. Here's a summary:

1. Transaction Status in Panaroma Decentralized Wallet: 
- When a user sends an Ethereum transaction, it initially appears with a 'pending' status on the Transactions tab right after it's sent.
- The status of the transaction changes to 'sending' for the sender and 'receiving' for the recipient as soon as it gets included in the blockchain, marking the first confirmation.
Transition to 'Completed' Status:
- The wallet app continues to display the status as 'sending' for the sender and 'receiving' for the recipient until at least 10 blocks have passed (equivalent to 10 confirmations).
- After reaching 10 confirmations, the status changes to 'completed,' indicated by a checkmark along with a timestamp.
Monitoring on Public Ethereum Block Explorers:

In addition to monitoring within the Panaroma Decentralized app, users have the option to use publicly available Ethereum block explorers such as https://etherscan.io.
Users can search for the transaction ID on these block explorers to obtain detailed information about the transaction's status, confirmations, and other relevant details.
This comprehensive monitoring system ensures that users can track the progress of their Ethereum transactions within the Panaroma Decentralized wallet and cross-verify the information on public block explorers for added transparency and confirmation.
